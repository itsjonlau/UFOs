we were successfully able to add multiple layers of filters in our "filter search" portion while adding more search options creating a bettter dynamic table. This makes the search portion / website a bit more user friendly for the user.

Summary 

a drawback in this analysis is the limitations javascript has when it comes to "case sensitivity" which might hinder a users ability to accurately use our newly added search functions. 
some recommendations to improve this would be to add a portion with step by step instructions on what you can and can not search. 
secondly another option would be to redefine certain filters we placed such as the "shapes filters" its very broad and would think that it might be a bit better to impliment a different type of filter in place of it.
